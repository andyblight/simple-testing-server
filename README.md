simple-testing-server
=====================

A stupidly simple Python server that allows you to test client code before you have a server that actually works.
Allows you to test JSON responses with the proper headers built in, and also custom error codes.



Motivation
---

So say you want to build some sort of application that connects to a client... great! But how are you going to deal with separating the development between the application logic and the backend API? Where are your API calls supposed to go before that server exists? Enter this project.

Example Usage
---

Start by spinning up the server using

```sh
python simpleTestingServer.py --port <PORT>
```

### GET

This server uses JSON as the default object structure. Say you want to get an example JSON response from your server.
Suppose you're modeling some data in your app. Let's call an example model ```events```. Then 

```GET http://localhost:<PORT>/events``` 

will return to you the contents of a 
file called ```events.json``` with proper headers. This file is up to you to create and place in the same folder as the Python script.

More generally, ```GET http://localhost:<PORT>/<model_name>``` will return an ```application/json``` response 
with content taken from a file called ```<model_name>.json``` placed in the same folder as the script.
BYO example JSON files. (use the ```--path``` options if these files are in a different directory)

### POST

To make a post request with a successful (200) response:

```POST http://localhost:<PORT>/success```

Want a failure (500)? Try

```POST http://localhost:<PORT>/error```

Those two response codes aren't good enough for you? Fine.

```POST http://localhost:<PORT>/<response_code>```

The body accepts parameters in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.

Set Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    POST http://localhost:<PORT>/any_url
    p1=v1&p2=v2&p3=v3

The result is parsed and returned back as JSON

    {
       "p2":"v2",
       "p3":"v3",
       "p1":"v1"
    }


There you have it.

Options
---

A list of command line options:

* ```-h, --help``` - show a help message
* ```-p <PORT>,  --port <PORT>``` - run on a custom port
* ```--path <PATH>``` - keep your sample data in a custom path

Compatibility
---

AFAIK all versions of Python3+. If you don't have ```argparse``` installed, the custom port won't 
work and it will just default to ```PORT=8003``` every time.
